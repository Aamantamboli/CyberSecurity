**What is OWASP?**

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an international non-profit organization focused on improving the security of web applications. They offer free resources, tools, documentation, and a global community to help anyone improve their web application security.

**What is the OWASP Top 10?**

The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly updated report that outlines the 10 most critical security risks to web applications. It serves as an "awareness document" for developers and security professionals to help them prioritize their security efforts and mitigate the most common and impactful vulnerabilities. The most recent list is from 2021.

### **Summary of the OWASP Top 10 (2021)**

Here is a brief summary of each of the 10 security risks:

1.  **Broken Access Control:** This occurs when a system's access controls are not properly enforced, allowing attackers to bypass authorization and gain access to restricted information or functionality.
2.  **Cryptographic Failures:** This category focuses on the failure to properly protect sensitive data, both when it's stored and when it's being transmitted. It can lead to data breaches if encryption is not used correctly or at all.
3.  **Injection:** Injection attacks happen when an attacker sends untrusted data to a code interpreter, tricking it into executing malicious commands. A common example is a SQL injection, where an attacker inserts SQL code into a form field to manipulate a database. This category also now includes Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
4.  **Insecure Design:** This new category in the 2021 list highlights vulnerabilities that are present in the core design and architecture of an application, rather than just in the implementation. An insecure design cannot be fixed with perfect code.
5.  **Security Misconfiguration:** This is a very common vulnerability caused by using default configurations, having unnecessary features enabled, or providing overly detailed error messages that reveal too much information to an attacker.
6.  **Vulnerable and Outdated Components:** This risk involves using software components (like libraries or frameworks) with known security vulnerabilities. Because these components are often used on many websites, a single vulnerability can put thousands of applications at risk if they are not updated.
7.  **Identification and Authentication Failures:** This risk involves weaknesses in an application's login system. Flaws in authentication can allow attackers to compromise user accounts or even gain administrative access.
8.  **Software and Data Integrity Failures:** This new category addresses the risk of an application making assumptions about the integrity of its software, data, or updates. It can lead to malicious code being injected through insecure software updates or third-party plugins.
9.  **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:** This vulnerability refers to the lack of proper logging and monitoring, which can prevent an organization from detecting and responding to a data breach in a timely manner.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** This is a type of attack where a web application is tricked into sending a request to an unexpected, and often protected, resource. An attacker can use this to access or manipulate data that they should not be able to reach.
