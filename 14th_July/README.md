## 1\. Introduction to Acunetix

Acunetix is a specialized web vulnerability scanner. Its primary function is to:

  * Identify weaknesses in websites and web applications.
  * Pinpoint specific vulnerable areas, significantly reducing manual testing time.
  * Efficiently shortlist potential attack vectors, streamlining the vulnerability assessment process.

## 2\. Installation Process

**Important Pre-installation Step:**

  * **Disable Antivirus:** Before starting the installation, it is crucial to temporarily disable your antivirus software, including Windows Defender. This step is necessary to prevent any interference with the installation process and is a one-time requirement.

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Download Acunetix:** Obtain the `Acunetix Premium Plus On-Premises` file. (The video specifies downloading it from a Telegram channel, which may not be an official source.)
2.  **Extract Files:** Right-click the downloaded archive file and select "Extract to" a chosen location. You will likely be prompted for a password (the video provides this password).
3.  **Run Setup:** Navigate to the newly extracted folder and locate the `Setup` executable file. Run this file to begin the installation wizard.
4.  **Follow On-Screen Prompts:**
      * Click "Next" to proceed through the initial setup screens.
      * Accept the license agreement.
      * Provide the default email and password when prompted (these credentials are also provided within the video).
5.  **Complete Installation:** Follow the remaining prompts in the setup wizard until the installation is complete. Close the application once it indicates successful installation.

## 3\. Cracking Acunetix 

**Note:** The video demonstrates a "cracking" process. Using cracked software may be illegal and comes with significant security risks, including malware and lack of support. Proceed at your own risk.

1.  **Stop Acunetix Services:**
      * Open the Windows search bar and type "Services". Run the Services application as an administrator.
      * In the Services window, locate and select "Acunetix Database" and "Acunetix Supervisor".
      * Right-click on each service and select "Stop".
2.  **Run Crack File:**
      * Go back to your extracted Acunetix folder.
      * Open the "Crack" subfolder.
      * Run the `Acunetix Premium Plus OnPremise` application located in this folder *as an administrator*.
      * The video states this action will successfully crack the software.

## 4\. Using Acunetix for Scanning

After successful installation and "cracking" (if applicable), you can begin scanning web applications for vulnerabilities.

1.  **Launch Acunetix:** Open Acunetix from your desktop shortcut. It will typically open in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2.  **Login:** Log in using the email and password provided during installation (or the default credentials from the video).
3.  **Start a New Scan:** On the Acunetix dashboard, click the "New Scan" button.
4.  **Add Target:** In the "Targets" section, click "Add Target".
5.  **Enter Website URL:** Input the full URL of the website you wish to scan (e.g., `testphp.vulnweb.com`).
6.  **Save Target:** Click "Save" to add this website as a target.
7.  **Configure Scan Settings:**
      * **Description:** Provide a descriptive name for your scan (e.g., "Daily Scan", "Initial Assessment").
      * **Site Login:** If the website requires authentication to access all its pages, enable "Site Login". This is crucial for comprehensive scanning of authenticated areas.
      * **Credentials:** If "Site Login" is enabled, enter the appropriate username and password for the target website.
8.  **Start Scan:** Click "Scan," and then "Create Scan" to initiate the vulnerability assessment.
9.  **Monitor Scan Progress:** The scan details page will display real-time progress, including scan duration, number of requests made, response times, and identified paths.
10. **View Vulnerabilities:** As the scan progresses or upon its completion, navigate to the "Vulnerabilities" tab. Here, Acunetix will list all discovered weaknesses, categorized by type (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Directory Traversal).
11. **Test Vulnerabilities (Example: XSS):** The video demonstrates manual verification of vulnerabilities. For instance, to test an XSS vulnerability, you might manually inject a JavaScript payload (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into a website's search bar or other input field to see if it triggers an alert pop-up.

## 5\. Understanding Automated Scanners and Their Limitations

It's vital to understand the implications and limitations of using automated web vulnerability scanners like Acunetix:

  * **High Request Volume:** Automated scanners generate a very large number of HTTP requests in a short period (e.g., thousands of requests in minutes).
  * **Potential for DoS/DDoS:** This high volume can potentially overwhelm a website's server, mimicking a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, especially on sites with limited infrastructure.
  * **Website Owner Restrictions:** Many website owners explicitly prohibit the use of automated scanners on their sites due to the risk of service disruption.
  * **Scanning During Off-Peak Hours:** If you have permission to scan, it's often recommended or even required to perform scans during off-peak hours (e.g., late night/early morning) to minimize impact on legitimate users.
  * **False Positives:** Automated scanners can sometimes report "false positives," which are identified vulnerabilities that are not actually exploitable in a real-world scenario. Therefore, manual verification by a human security tester is frequently necessary to confirm and prioritize true vulnerabilities.
  * **Importance of Permission:** **Crucially, you must only use automated scanners on websites for which you have explicit, written permission from the owner.** Scanning without permission is illegal and can lead to severe legal consequences. Always adhere to ethical hacking guidelines and local laws.
